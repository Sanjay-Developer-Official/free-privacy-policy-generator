# Contributing more 3rd Party Service's Privacy links
The webapp uses a JSON array to populate the list of 3rd party services section. If you want contribute a new 3rd party service for the section then open a Pull Request which simply adds a new JSON item to the JSON Array in [`public/js/thirdpartyservices.js`](public/js/thirdpartyservices.js)

The format is very simple and you only need to provide fill the fields as follows:
```
[
  ..
  }, // Donot forget to add a ',' before adding your new item in the array
  {
    name: 'Google Play Services',
    model: 'gps', // this is stores the name of the model
    gps: true, // this stores the state of the model, notice the key is the same as the model above. It is required by code.
    logo: 'images/gps.png',
    link: {
      privacy: 'https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/',
      terms: ''
    }
  }
]
```
> Note: You also will have to drop the logo image into the [`public/images/`](public/images/) folder. Make sure the logo is 160 × 160 in size.

# Pull Requests
I welcome and encourage all pull requests. It usually will take me within 24-48 hours to respond to any issue or request. Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure timely addition of your request:
  1. If its a feature, bugfix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.
  1. Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge :)
  1. Pull requests _must_ be made against `develop` branch. Any other branch (unless specified by the maintainers) will get rejected.
  1. Check for existing [issues](https://github.com/Sanjay-Developer-Official/free-privacy-policy-generator/issues/) first, before filing an issue.
  1. Have fun!
